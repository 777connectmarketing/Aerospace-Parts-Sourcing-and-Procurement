# Aerospace Parts Sourcing and Procurement  
Optimizing reliability, compliance, and supply chain efficiency in the aerospace industry.

## Introduction  
Aerospace parts sourcing and procurement is a highly regulated and complex process. Manufacturers, MRO (Maintenance, Repair & Overhaul) facilities, and defense organizations require components that meet strict standards for traceability, safety, and performance.  
Effective procurement minimizes downtime, reduces costs, and ensures aircraft airworthiness.

## Why Aerospace Procurement Is Complex  
- Highly regulated industry (FAA, EASA, DoD)  
- Long lead times for critical components  
- Risk of counterfeit or non-traceable parts  
- Need for strict documentation and certifications  
- Aging aircraft fleets requiring hard-to-find parts  
- Global supply chain instability and price fluctuations

## Key Types of Aerospace Parts  

### **1. NSN (National Stock Number) Parts**  
Used extensively by defense and government agencies for standardized procurement.

### **2. Rotables & Expendables**  
- **Rotables:** Landing gear, avionics systems, actuators  
- **Expendables:** O-rings, filters, fasteners, seals  

### **3. MRO Components**  
Sensors, LRUs (line replaceable units), electrical assemblies, pumps, and valves used in maintenance cycles.

### **4. OEM & PMA Parts**  
- **OEM:** Original manufacturer components  
- **PMA:** FAA-approved aftermarket parts, cost-effective alternatives

## Essential Certifications to Look For  
- **AS9120B** – Aerospace distributor quality certification  
- **AS9100D** – Aerospace manufacturing standard  
- **ISO 9001:2015** – General quality management  
- **FAA 8130-3** – Airworthiness approval  
- **EASA Form 1** – European airworthiness document  

Working with certified suppliers ensures authenticity and airworthiness compliance.

## The Aerospace Procurement Lifecycle  
1. **Requirement Identification**  
2. **Supplier Shortlisting & Evaluation**  
3. **RFQ (Request for Quote)**  
4. **Compliance & Certification Check**  
5. **Purchase Order (PO) Placement**  
6. **Quality Assurance & Incoming Inspection**  
7. **Inventory & Lifecycle Management**

## Challenges in Aerospace Parts Sourcing  
- Counterfeit components and missing trace documentation  
- Long lead times and supply chain disruptions  
- Obsolete or discontinued parts for older aircraft  
- Inconsistent documentation between suppliers  
- Volatile pricing and fluctuating inventory availability

## Best Practices for Efficient Procurement  

### ✔ Maintain a Verified Supplier Database  
Work only with AS9120B and ISO-certified distributors.

### ✔ Use Digital Tools  
Implement automated RFQ systems, traceability software, and compliance verification tools.

### ✔ Conduct Regular Supplier Audits  
Check quality, delivery performance, and documentation accuracy.

### ✔ Keep Safety Stock  
Protects operations from unexpected supply chain delays.

### ✔ Avoid Single-Supplier Dependency  
Use multi-sourcing for mission-critical components.

### ✔ Demand Complete Trace Documentation  
CoC, Form 1, 8130, manufacturing trace logs, test results, etc.
